## Current Applications
### Registration/Login System
Lets you create a new account. Every account has its own row in the database and every user has:

 - User ID (Automated number) 
 - Username
 - Password (Hashed with SHA1)
 - Account type
 - Personal Message

### Default Application
The first application you will encounter is a personal message app. It lets you create a message and store it. This means that every user can create their own personal message that will always appear when that specific user logs in.
